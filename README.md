## Why GraphQL?

- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: GraphQL allows precise data fetching, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

- **Single API Endpoint**: With a single endpoint, GraphQL simplifies API interactions, consolidating multiple REST calls.

- **Strong Typing**: GraphQL schemas provide a clear contract between the client and server, enhancing code quality and preventing runtime errors.

## Why React?

- **Declarative UI**: React's declarative approach simplifies UI development, making it easier to understand and maintain.

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Encourages modular, reusable components, improving code organization and scalability.

- **Virtual DOM**: Optimizes rendering for better performance, ensuring efficient updates without unnecessary re-renders.
